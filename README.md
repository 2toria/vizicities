# ViziCities
__Bringing cities to life using the power of open data and the Web__

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/0r0u0t1c2g1o3U1y3r2x/vizicities-combined-ssao.jpg)

[ViziCities](http://vizicities.com) is a 3D city and data visualisation platform, powered by WebGL. It's sole purpose is to change the way you look at cities and the data contained within them. It is the brainchild of [Robin Hawkes](http://twitter.com/robhawkes) and [Peter Smart](http://twitter.com/petewsmart) &mdash; [get in touch](#contact--community) if you'd like to discuss the project with them in more detail.

### What does it do?

ViziCities aims to combine data visualisation with a 3D representation of a city to provide a better understanding what's going on. It's a powerful new way of looking at and understanding urban areas. 

Aside from seeing a city in 3D, here are some of the others things you'll have the power to do:

* View public transport (eg. buses, trains, planes) [flowing around a city in realtime](https://vimeo.com/67869313)
* Use vehicles powered by artificial intelligence to [perform realistic traffic simulation](https://vimeo.com/66512057)
* Visualise [social data in realtime](https://vimeo.com/67872925)
* Overlay historic and static data (eg. census data) using traditional techniques (eg. heatmaps)
* And much more&hellip;


### Further information

In 2013, Peter and Robin spoke in detail about ViziCities at Front Trends.

## Current features

### 0.1.0

* Buildings
* Processing of geographic features into 3D objects using Web Workers


## Future features

* Tests and build status (TravisCI)


## Getting started

ViziCities is at an incredibly early stage right now, but it's usable if you know what you're doing. The follow steps should get you up and running without too much trouble.

### Building ViziCities

To start off, you'll need to build ViziCities and get an up-to-date JavaScript file.

* Installing Grunt
* Installing NPM packages
* Building ViziCities with Grunt
* Serving examples using Grunt

### Data formats

Visualising geographic features lies at the core of ViziCities. To make sure features render correctly you'll need to [use the correct data formats](https://github.com/robhawkes/ViziCities/blob/master/DATA-FORMATTING.md).

### Using ViziCities

* Using the built in example
* Viewing your own city
